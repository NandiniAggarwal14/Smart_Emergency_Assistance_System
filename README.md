# Smart_Emergency_Assistance_System
This project focuses on the development of a Smart Emergency Assistance System designed to promptly alert the nearest emergency service stations in the event of a crisis. With just one click, the user’s real-time location—whether they are affected or present at the emergency site, is automatically captured and transmitted via SMS to nearby emergency centers using geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). This allows the appropriate emergency services to be notified and dispatched as quickly as possible, based on the nature and severity of the emergency.
